# Source-Warning
A decomp of Content Warning 1.16.a

Source Warning is a decompilation of Content Warning 1.16.a, this is only for curiosity and not for piracy. I will not be publicly providing certain files needed for the game to compile simply to not allow anyone to compile the game.

Current Status:
Assets Decomped: Kinda*
Scripts Decomped: Nope.
Compilable: Nope.
Scenes Viewable: Maybe?
Moddable: No.
