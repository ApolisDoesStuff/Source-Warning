# Source-Warning
A decomp of Content Warning 1.16.a

Source Warning is a decompilation of Content Warning 1.16.a, this is only for curiosity and not for piracy. I will not be publicly providing certain files needed for the game to compile simply to not allow anyone to compile the game.

## Current Status:
### Assets Decomped: Kinda*
### Scripts Decomped: Nope.
### Compilable: Nope.
### Scenes Viewable: Maybe?
### Moddable: No.

## Notes.
This decomp is no where near finished, and might never be finished. Landfall might request for me to take down the decomp and thats fine. this is just from my dumb curiosity to see how the game works. also i will not do the latest versions. i am only doing this version (latest as of 20.05.24).
